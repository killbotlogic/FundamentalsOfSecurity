## This example shows the impracticality of trying to find a collision when using a collision resistant hash function

# Set up the initial key, message and modified message (m_dash)
k = "evilgenius"
m = "Your friend Mallory changed her phone number to 02%d" % random.randint(1000,10000)
# All strings in Python 3 are Unicode by default - we need to convert them to ASCII for use in hash functions
m = m.encode("ascii")
m_dash = "Alice sent a message to your wall -- 'I hate you!' (post id: %d)"

print("Finding collisions against %s" % m)
print()


# Try to find hash collisions for increasingly lengthier hashes
for shortened_to in range(3,10):
  # Calculate the hash up to N hex characters which we want to match against
  original_hash = SHA256.new(m).hexdigest()[:shortened_to]
  # Each hex character represents 4 bits as 0-9A-F = 16 = 2 ** 4
  print("Attempting to match simplified %d-hex char hash (%d bits): %s" % (shortened_to, shortened_to * 4, original_hash))

  start_time = time()
  total_hashes = 0
  nonce = 0
  while True:
    # This nonce is the value we use to modify the message such that it will have a different hash each time
    nonce += 1
    updated_text = m_dash % nonce
    updated_text = updated_text.encode("ascii")
    h = SHA256.new(updated_text)
    impersonator_hash = h.hexdigest()[:shortened_to]
    # If the 'impersonator hash' collides with the original hash, we found our collision
    if original_hash == impersonator_hash:
      break
    # Else, loop around and try another variation
    total_hashes += 1

  end_time = time()
